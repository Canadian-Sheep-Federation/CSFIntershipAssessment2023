# Background

As a QA intern at CSF, you will need to test web applications, file
outputs and more for quality and correctness.

# Assessment

Please answer the following questions:

## Something is not displaying properly in the browser and you want to learn more about it. How do you go about doing that? (Looking for what tools and specific steps you would take to investigate the error)
I would first make note of what isn't displaying properly in the browser. The browser console may display any warnings or errors that would cause something to not display properly. My next course of action would be to check the source code of the webpage, so if it is a design element like a button or label, I would inspect the code that is supposed to build it and ensure that there are no syntax errors and that it has been properly added to the interface. If the thing that isn't displaying properly is the result of user action such as pressing a button, scrolling, etc., I would check that the user action is being recorded and the code that is meant to run as a result of the action is being run at the right time.

## Have you ever broken a piece of software? How did you break it? How did you fix it?
Yes I have broken a piece of software before. Last semester my computer science course required me to build a Java program, for which I chose to build a music player application. I was adding a new feature to the graphical interface of my application. In doing so, I introduced a bug that caused the application to not update the state of the queue when the user clicked the "view queue" button.

To fix the issue, I followed the standard debugging process by firstly isolating the problem by reviewing the changes I had made to the code since the last time it ran successfully. I utilised the debugger of the IDE I was using to observe the trace of the program to find any inconsistencies with the desired and actual result of the code. Once I had identified the root cause of the issue, I worked on fixing the bug by updating the code and testing the application thoroughly to ensure that the fix did not cause any other issues.

I believe that breaking the software was a valuable learning experience as it taught me the importance of testing thoroughly and taking a systematic approach to debugging. It also helped me improve my problem-solving skills and gain a more developed understanding of how software applications work.

## Describe your experiene with code review.
I believe that code review is a crucial part of the software development process which helps ensure that code being written is high quality, maintainable, and meets the requirements/standards decided by the team. In my previous internship at an ecommerce company, we had a formal code review process in place for all changes to the code that was used to control the database of suppliers. This process involved the entire department going through the code together and discussing why certain changes were made, as well as whether they were buggy and could be improved on. Through participating in this once a week during my internship, I found code review to be very valuable, since it helps catch a lot of errors early and ensures that the code is of high quality and maintainable.
