There are several ways to extend and improve the application and API mentioned above. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Add authentication and authorization**: We could add authentication and authorization to your API to restrict access to certain endpoints or data. 

2. **Improve the user interface**: We could improve the user interface of the React frontend to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing. This could involve adding more features or functionality to the form, such as input validation or error handling.

3. **Use a more robust database**: 

4. **Add more endpoints**: We could add more endpoints to your API to allow users to retrieve or manipulate data in different ways. This could involve creating additional models or views in Django, or creating new React components to interact with the API.
