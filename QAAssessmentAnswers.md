## Something is not displaying properly in the browser and you want to learn more about it. How do you go about doing that? (Looking for what tools and specific steps you would take to investigate the error)

Here are some of the possible steps I would take to investigate frontend issues. The order of this can be changed depending on the exact nature of the problem:

* **Reproduce the Issue:** I would start by trying to reproduce the problem to get a clear understanding of what is happening. I would carefully follow the steps or actions that lead to the issue, ensuring that it is consistently replicable rather than sporadic.
* **Inspect the Web Page:** To investigate further, I would open the browser's developer tools, which can be accessed through the browser's menu or by pressing F12. Using the "Elements" or "Inspector" panel, I would examine the HTML structure of the web page to identify any missing, misplaced, or incorrectly rendered elements that could be causing the display issue.

* **Check the Console:** Moving to the "Console" panel in the developer tools, I would look for any error messages or warnings related to JavaScript, CSS, or other resources that might be contributing to the problem. These messages often provide valuable insights into the underlying cause of the issue.
* **Review Network Activity:** To investigate potential issues with resource loading, I would switch to the "Network" panel in the developer tools and refresh the page. By monitoring the network activity, I could identify any failed or blocked requests, indicating missing or improperly loaded resources such as JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, or images. Analyzing these relevant requests would provide valuable clues to help troubleshoot the issue.

* **Validate HTML and CSS:** I would utilize online validation tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service to check the web page's HTML structure and CSS syntax. Validating the code would help identify and rectify any validation errors or warnings that could be causing the display issue.
* **Clear Cache and Cookies:** To eliminate potential conflicts caused by cached files or stored cookies, I would clear the browser cache and cookies. This action ensures that I am loading the latest version of the web page without any cached artifacts interfering with the rendering process.

* **Test in Different Browsers:** To determine if the issue is browser-specific, I would test the web page in multiple browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. By doing so, I can identify if the issue occurs consistently across all browsers or if it is specific to a particular one, helping narrow down the root cause.
* **Consult Documentation and Online Resources:** I would extensively research the specific technologies and frameworks employed in the web application. Checking official documentation, forums, and online resources like Stack Overflow would provide insights into whether others have encountered similar issues or if there are any known bugs or compatibility problems.

* **Collaborate with Development Team:** If I'm unable to identify the cause or resolution independently, I would collaborate with the development team responsible for the web application. Sharing my findings, including error messages, console logs, and steps to reproduce the issue, would facilitate efficient troubleshooting and resolution.
* **Document and Report Findings:** Throughout the investigation process, I would diligently document my observations, steps taken, and any relevant findings. Once I identify the root cause or potential solutions, I would prepare a report summarizing my findings and proposed resolutions. This report would be shared with the development team, project stakeholders, or any other relevant parties.

## Have you ever broken a piece of software? How did you break it? How did you fix it?

Nowadays I am usually very careful to do the proper testing and robust development as well as managing feature branches in order to prevent exactly this. However I do remember breaking production in an earlier internship wherein I had to add some extra data fields to a class on a customer's request. While deleting lint code, I had accidentally also deleted a crucial method to self-update fields, that I thought to be very trivial at the time. Once production was down I almost immediately realized my mistake and took the time to read the past commit graph, past documentation, and paint myself a more global picture on how it all works. Once I did this, not only did i re-implement that function but I also found a way to globally improve it by converting it into a custom hook that was abstracted on the entire scope of the project so it could be called whenever necessary.

## Describe your experiene with code review.

In the professional side, I have usually worked under a higher-ranking engineer who took time to review my code or review it with me, and hence I wasn't responsible to be reviewing others' codebases. I did rigourous reviewing of my own code to ensure minimal change at the official review phase. I have however done lots of code review in my team projects in college where we were developing apps for various purposes and as project lead, it was my job to manage the remote repository, the Scrum board, and the commit graph (wherein I had to review all the code before they were ready to be merged with the deployment branch). This code review would usually be done alone since I had already coached my team on codebase efficiency, conciseness, and descriptive commits. But whenever the need arose for clarification I wouldn't hesitate to contact the subteam or the specific team member involved in order to carry out the rest of the review together and work side-by-side to get it functional.
