This is an adopt a pet application made with node js, express, and mongodb. You can add pets for adoption, update pet information, and delete pets from the database.

To run this web application:

1. In terminal type: ``` npm install ```
2. In terminal type: ``` npm start ```
3. Open up http://localhost:3000 on browser
4. Enjoy!

Note on Assesment: 
I was not able to get the application to consume the public api key, possibly because the api key is faulty. However, what I would have done for the application to consume a public api can be seen in ./server/model/model.js

Discuss how the application and api could be extended and improved:

The application could be extended by being able to choose from various pet shelters, and then adding, deleting, updating pet information within each pet shelter.
