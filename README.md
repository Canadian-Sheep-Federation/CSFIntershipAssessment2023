This is an adopt a pet application made with node js, express, and mongodb. You can add pets for adoption, update pet information, and delete pets from the database.

To run this web application:

1. In terminal type: ``` npm start ```
2. Open up http://localhost:3000 on browser
3. Enjoy!

Note on Assesment: 
I was not able to get the application to consume the public api key, possibly because the api key is faulty. However, what I would have done for the application to consume a public api can be seen in ./server/model/model.js
